# Day 3: HTML and CSS Grid Page

Welcome to Day 3 of my 100-day journey of building and learning something new every day! Today, I've created a HTML and CSS grid page where I've divided the layout into different sections including a header, navigation sidebar, main content area, right sidebar, and footer. Each section is styled with different colors, occupying their designated spaces within the grid layout.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a HTML and CSS grid page with distinct sections (header, navigation, main content, right sidebar, footer) and assign different colors to each section, illustrating their individual spaces within the layout.

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS.

## Features
